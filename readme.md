# Simple App cribbed from the "Test app for Pluralsight course"

This is a quick and dirty test node.js app cobbled together for the purposes of demonstrating a basic CI/CD workflow with Docker Hub for a Pluralsight video training course (https://github.com/nigelpoulton/pluralsight-docker-CI)..

## Instructions for use

All of the files included in the .zip file (available to Plus subscribers) should be unzipped into a new directory.

Initializing a Git repo and making a remote of it on GitHub are explained in Module 2 of the course. Check out question #2423777 on stackoverflow.com.

The viewer should have Git installed and have a GitHub account. In addition, you will need to link your GitHub account with the CI system and Docker Hub.
